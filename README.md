# Pair tiles

![](preview.png)

My first try of React. To win this game, you need to select all pairs of tiles.
This game is powered by [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) mainly for mobile.

### Run project locally
In the project directory, you can run `npm start`.
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
